        <p>Rendition of the Nauvoo Temple published in Harper's Monthly</p>
        <p>The Latter Day Saints made preparations to build a temple soon after establishing their headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1839. On April 6, 1841, the temple's cornerstone was laid under the direction of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement and Sidney Rigdon gave the principal oration. At its base the building was 128 feet (39 m) long and 88 feet (27 m) wide with a clock tower and weather vane reaching to a total height of 165 feet (50 m)—a 60% increase over the dimensions of the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple had a full basement which housed a baptismal font. Because the Saints had to abandon Nauvoo, the building was not entirely completed. The basement with its font was finished, as were the first floor assembly hall and the attic. When these parts of the building were completed they were used for performing ordinances (basement and attic) or for worship services (first floor assembly hall).</p>

        <p>The Nauvoo Temple was designed in the Greek Revival style by architect William Weeks, under the direction of Joseph Smith. Weeks' design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including Sunstones, Moonstones, and Starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the Three Degrees of Glory in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be "a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb's wife" (Wandle Mace, Autobiography 207 (BYU Special Collections)). In this regard Mace references John's statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the "woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." This explains why the Starstones are at the top of the temple ("crown of twelve stars"), the Sunstones in the middle ("clothed with the sun") and the Moonstones at the bottom ("moon under her feet").</p>

    <p>The building of the Nauvoo Temple was “an event of the greatest importance to the Church and the world,” wrote the Prophet Joseph Smith.1 In September of 1842 he issued a rallying call and affirmed the importance of temple ordinances: “The earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children. … For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. … Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad” (D&C 128:18, 22).</p>

    <p>Such was the motivation for the Saints as they willingly sacrificed everything to complete the temple and receive their endowments and sealings before being driven from Nauvoo. The written accounts of those who participated in this effort reveal their love for the Lord and their reverence for His house. It is a story filled with trials and triumph.</p>
    
    <p><h3>A Call to Help</h3></p>
    <p>At the October 1840 conference, the Prophet called upon all to help. Though some of the construction would require payment, he explained that the temple would be built by the tithes of the people and that male members would perform nearly all the labor. The response of one of the stonecutters, Charles Lambert, was typical. He “committed with Brother William Player that [he] would stick to the temple pay or no pay until finished and did.”</p>
    
    <p>The extent to which the Saints sacrificed is recorded in a letter from the Twelve: “Many have volunteered to labor continually, and the brethren generally are giving one-tenth part of their time, or one-tenth part of their income, according to circumstances; while … sisters … are knitting socks and mittens, and preparing garments for the laborers, so that they may be made as comfortable as possible during the coming winter.”</p>
    
    <p>Mercy Fielding Thompson told of her experience: “At one time after seeking earnestly to know from the Lord if there was anything that I could do for the building up of the Kingdom of God, a most pleasant sensation came over me with the following words. Try to get the Sisters to subscribe one cent per week for the purpose of buying glass and nails for the Temple. I went immediately to Brother Joseph. … He told me to go ahead and the Lord would bless me.”4 This “penny subscription” soon became a major fund-raising effort.</p>
    
    <p>Others sold their china dishes. Elizabeth Kirby wrote: “I could not think of anything that would grieve me to part with in my possession, except [my deceased husband’s] watch. So, I gave it up to help build the Nauvoo Temple.”</p>
    
    <p>Louisa Barnes Pratt’s writings reflect the reality of their sacrifice: “I started in good faith to go to the Temple office to bestow my offering. Suddenly a temptation came over me … that [this] money would relieve my present necessities. Then I resisted. Said I, ‘If I have no more than a crust of bread each day for a week, I will pay this money into the treasury.’”</p>
