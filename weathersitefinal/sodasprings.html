        The city is named for the hundreds of natural springs of carbonated water that are 
        located in and around the city.[6] The springs were well known to Native Americans 
        and were a famous landmark along the Oregon Trail in the middle 19th century. Today 
        the city is also known as the location of the Soda Springs Geyser, which was unleashed 
        in 1934 when "town fathers" were looking for hot water for a "hot pool" bathing attraction. 
        Instead they drilled into a chamber of highly pressurized carbon dioxide gas and cold water 
        and the geyser was released. After running for weeks, and flooding the downtown area, it was 
        capped and manually released when requested as a tourist attraction. Now it is let loose every 
        hour on the hour by a timed release valve. Its height and volume have not decreased after many years. 
        There are viewing platforms at either end of the travertine mound where the geyser erupts. Interpretive 
        signs are located on the platforms explaining this phenomenon.
        
        Soda Springs is also the location of one of the Ground Observer Corps sites..
